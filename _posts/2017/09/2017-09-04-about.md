Established in 2011, the New Trier Fantasy Football started out as an amateur league of eight people, and has since developed into one of the premier twelve person leagues in Cook County, Illinois. Only five (Jack Miller, Nat Swinger, Nicholas Kebo, Andrew Kost, and John Keenan) of the original eight remain, with the rest having joined after the league's first year. Led by commissioner Jack Miller and assistant commissioner Nat Swinger, the NTFFL uses ESPN as its platform for fantasy football. It is a half PPR league with decimal scoring and a FAAB system of waivers. Besides that, it has all of the same rules as a standard ESPN league.
