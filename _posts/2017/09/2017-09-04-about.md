Established in 2011, the New Trier Fantasy Football started out as an amateur league of 8 people, and has since developed into the premier 12 person league in Cook County, Illinois. Only 5 of the original 8 remain, with the rest having joined after the league's first year. Led by commissioner Jack Miller and Assistant Commissioner Nat Swinger, the NTTFL uses ESPN as its platform for fantasy football. It is a 0.5 points per reception league, with the rest of the scoring rules standard.
