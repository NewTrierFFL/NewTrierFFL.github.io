1. Marcus Mariyoda:<br>
This team has depth and studs. Todd gurley is on pace for 28 touchdowns and is putting on a show this year. He's making up for his lackluster 2016 performance in which I don't think he put up 7 touchdowns the entire year. Mike Evans is a known stud at wr1 and Larry Fitzgerald is showing us he can still put up numbers even though he's 42 years old. This team has no real weaknesses and with an undefeated record through four games, he should be locked in for a playoff spot.
<br>
2. Butters nation:<br>
It's hard to do a power ranking for such a despicable owner and organization but I'm getting paid so I will. The nation has put up numbers each week and has the best rb duo in the league and it's not even close. Travis Kelce is a lock for top5 TE numbers on the year and Justin tucker is the best player in football--real or fantasy. His wide receiver duo looks good at first but amari cooper is ass and dez Bryant high key has no hands. Look for butters to move around his team in the next few weeks. If your best 3 rbs can combine for 45 each week, the rest should fall into place. Tough matchup this week against the dippshits but a 3-2 record still puts him in a good position. This team is one good wide receiver away from being the odds on favorite in this league. 
<br>
3. Mud dogs:<br>
Millers team is very very very solid. He has one really good player and then everyone else is ok. He's made more trades than usual in the past couple weeks to give his team more firepower but he will need to get double digits from some of his mediocre players if he wants to contend for a title. 
<br>
4. Brandy bunch:<br>
I don't know how this man did it but kebo is proving all of us wrong. Ranked last in our preseason rankings, he has made moves that have put his team in a position to win a lot of games this year. He still has no rbs but will find ways to put up points with arguably the best wr duo in the league and arguably the goat in TB12. With lots of depth and studs, if this bunch can find a solid and consistent rb core, they will have the points to make noise come December. 
<br>
5. Sergio Dippshits:<br>
Prepare for this team to make a huge surge. Ignore the 1-3 record and just look at the team--solid across the board. The dippshits have two top ten wideouts, three top 15 rbs and a solid te, flex and qb. Diggs Allen Hyde mccaffrey Martin Parker and reed are up there with some of the best cores in this league. This team should get a plethora of points each week from every position that should be able to propel them to some wins and ultimately a repeat. 
<br>
6. I like hugging my cousins:<br>
This team has had rbs since the beginning of the year but they have come into relevance with the play of their white wide receivers. Chris hogan has 4 touchdowns in the past 3 games and Adam thielen quietly is top3 in the NFL in receiving yards. Melvin Gordon and CJ Anderson are quality fantasy running backs but are not actually good at football; both of these guys are not 100% sure to be lead backs by the end of the season. This team is really good right now but I'd be shocked if they get a playoff spot. 
<br>
7. Sea turtles:<br>
Gotta love what Mr. Keenan has done with this franchise in the last few weeks. Even though David Johnson is likely done for the year, his team is full of youth and upside that can explode any given week. With a strong core, if this team can sneak into the playoffs with David Johnson healthy, look for them to be a dark horse contender for the ship. 
<br>
8. Loquacious lamps:<br>
The Texans offense is the key for this squad. Last week they scored 57 points, but if they can't be consistent, then this team will suffer. Other than bell, Hopkins, and Miller, this team will struggle to find production from other positions on their team. Expect this team to be in a lot of close games in the next few weeks.
<br>
9. Cooking up in a crock pot:<br>
“Wow! Elis team is actually really good”- everyone last week. I'm not sure how it happened but just losing Dalvin cook made this team ten times worse. The bears tandem will make up his rbs and his WRs are solid but not great. Gronk will likely be his only matchup advantage each week. If gronk gets hurt or struggles, this team will as well. 
<br>
9. Knile River:<br>
This team is gonna need to get rb2 production rom Crowell and Wr2 production from crabtree. They have two of the best players in fantasy and should be able to win some games if they get production from other starters. 
<br>
11. Trust the process:<br>
It's becoming harder and harder to trust the process these days. Like this team is okay I guess. Lesean McCoy is good but other than that he's going to have to rely on inconsistent players on inconsistent offenses. 
<br>
12. Game of jones:<br>
This team always had good wideouts but with Julio and Doug baldwin playing through injuries, they might not get the production needed. With the worst rbs in the league, this team might not be able to overcome their 0-4 spot and will struggle to find a spot in the playoffs.
