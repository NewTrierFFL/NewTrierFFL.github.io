1. Marcus MariYODA:<br>
This team has above average depth to go along with some studs. Todd Gurley is on pace for 28 touchdowns and is putting on a show this year. He's making up for his lackluster 2016 performance in which he didm't put up 7 touchdowns the entire year, and now he's done it in four games. Mike Evans is a locked and loaded stud at WR1 and Larry Fitzgerald is showing us he can still put up numbers even though he's 42 years old. This team has no real weaknesses and with an undefeated record through four games, Gorney should be locked in for a playoff spot.
<br>
2. BUTTERS NATION:<br>
It's hard to do a power ranking for such a despicable owner and organization but I'm getting paid so I will. The Nation has put up numbers each week and has the best RB duo in the league and, frankly, it's not even close. Travis Kelce is a lock for top five TE numbers on the year and Justin Tucker is the best player in football--real or fantasy. His wide receiver duo looks good at first but Amari Cooper is underpeforming and that trend looks like it'll continue with Derek Carr out 2-6 weeks, and Dez Bryant high-key has no hands. Look for Butters to move around his team in the next few weeks. If your best 3 RBs can combine for 45 each week, the rest should fall into place. Tough matchup this week against the Dippshits but a 3-2 record still puts him in a good position. This team is one good wide receiver away from being the odds on favorite in this league.
<br>
3. SCLSU Mud Dogs:<br>
Millers team is very, very solid. He has one really good player and then everyone else is okay. He's made more trades than usual in the past couple weeks to give his team more firepower but he will need to get double digits from some of his mediocre players if he wants to contend for a title.
<br>
4. Brady Bunch:<br>
I don't know how this man did it but Kebo is proving all of us wrong. Ranked last in our preseason rankings, he has made moves that have put his team in a position to win a lot of games this year. He still has no RBs but will find ways to put up points with arguably the best WR duo in the league and arguably the goat in TB12. With lots of depth and studs, if this Bunch can find a solid and consistent RB core, they will have the points to make noise come December.
<br>
5. Sergio Dippshits:<br>
Prepare for this team to make a huge surge. Ignore the 1-3 record and just look at the team--solid across the board. The Dippshits have two top ten wideouts, two top 15 RBs and a solid TE, flex and QB. Diggs, Allen, Hyde, McCaffrey, Martin, Parker, and Reed are up there with some of the best cores in this league. This team should get a plethora of points each week from every position that should be able to propel them to some wins and ultimately a repeat. Please note that Ezra wrote this.
<br>
6. Team Podorovsky<br>
This team has had RBs since the beginning of the year but they have come into relevance with the play of their white wide receivers. Chris Hogan has 4 touchdowns in the past 3 games and Adam Thielen quietly is near the top of the league in receiving yards. Melvin Gordon and CJ Anderson are quality fantasy running backs who headline this team's core. This team is really solid right now but I'd be shocked if they get a playoff spot.
<br>
7. Sea Turtles:<br>
Gotta love what Mr. Keenan has done with this franchise in the last few weeks. Even though David Johnson is likely done for the year, his team is full of youth and upside that can explode any given week. With a strong core, if this team can sneak into the playoffs with David Johnson healthy, look for them to be a dark horse contender for the 'ship.
<br>
8. Loquacious Lamps:<br>
The Texans offense is the key for this squad. Last week the Houston duo of Miller and Hopkins scored 57 points, but if they can't be consistent, then this team will suffer. Other than Bell, Hopkins, and Miller, this team will struggle to find production from other positions on their team. Expect this team to be in a lot of close games in the next few weeks.
<br>
9. Cooking up in a crock pot:<br>
“Wow! Eli's team is actually really good!”- everyone last week. I'm not sure how it happened but just losing Dalvin Cook made this team ten times worse. The Bears tandem will make up his RBs and his WRs are solid but not great. Gronk will likely be his only matchup advantage each week. If Gronk gets hurt or struggles, this team will as well.
<br>
9. Knile River:<br>
This team is gonna need to get RB2 production from Crowell and WR2 production from crabtree. They have two of the best players in fantasy and should be able to win some games if they get production from other starters.
<br>
11. Trust the Process:<br>
It's becoming harder and harder to trust the process these days. Like, this team is okay, I guess. LeSean McCoy is a stud but other than that he's going to have to rely on inconsistent players on inconsistent offenses.
<br>
12. Game of Jones:<br>
This team always had good wideouts but with Julio and Doug Baldwin playing through injuries, they might not get the production needed. With the worst RBs in the league, this team might not be able to overcome their 0-4 spot and will struggle to find a spot in the playoffs.

It had to happen.

On Tuesday afternoon, Mud Dogs GM Jack Miller packaged Jordy Nelson with Alvin Kamara and sent them to the Brady Bunch in return for Jay Ajayi and Tyreek Hill.

And I got *flamed*. “That trade blew for you, Jack.” “Miller is no longer a contender.” “Miller, you’re silly.” “Miller, I don’t know about that trade”, to quote four immediate reactions from NTFFL league members and insiders. And I get it. Jordy Nelson was a top three receiver last year and less than a point away from the #1 overall WR (in standard leagues, Jordy was #1). And he’s picked up right where he left off at the age of 32, ranking third among all wide receivers after four weeks *despite missing a game.* Stefon Diggs, I love you, but Jordy Nelson has been on another level this season. And what did I get in return? Jay Ajayi - the #44 fantasy running back this season coming off two straight single digit weeks, one against the New Orleans Saints defense - and Tyreek Hill - an electrifying speedster who has a claim for a top twelve WR, but doesn’t offer anything near Jordy’s consistency. And I gave up Alvin Kamara, the most exciting player the world has never heard of, the rookie running back from Tennessee who’s taking over the Saints backfield.

For the next few hours, I regretted it, I thought John and Ezra and Teddy and Marc were right, that I got destroyed and I just packed a top three wide receiver in return for a second-round bust and an inconsistent gadget player. But, again, I had to do it.

These trade grades are going to have less to do with player-for-player nutshell grades and more to do with team composition and team building. Because trading away a stud wide receiver makes sense when your RB2 was previously either Alex Collins or newly-acquired Wayne Gallman, and trading for a stud wide receiver doesn’t make sense if it means your RB1 is Frank Gore. Theoretically, of course. So without further ado, thanks for reading my inner monologue/stupid into, here are the week four trade grades:

**Miller trades Jordy Nelson, Alvin Kamara to Kebo in return for Tyreek Hill and Jay Ajayi**

I’ll keep it short since I just wrote a pointless introduction all about this trade. Kebo got himself a top five wide receiver to go along with Michael Thomas, but lost RB1 Jay Ajayi, leaving him awfully barren at RB with Frank Gore and Andre Ellington. However, Jordy and Thomas is enough to keep this team near the top of the league, especially when Tom freaking Brady is quarterbacking. Miller got a much-needed RB in Ajayi, although the Dolphins offense looks anemic, and a solid fringe WR1/2 in Hill.

**Brady Bunch Grade: B-**<br>
**SCLSU Mud Dogs Grade: B**

**Griffen trades Bilal Powell to John in return for Allen Hurns**

Let me give you a scenario here. Your best running back is Marshawn Lynch (one game above ten points), and you’ve got both Julio and Doug Baldwin at wide receiver. What do you do? If you answered “Trade away my second-best running back who just became the clear starter on his NFL team”, you’re . . . right? Apparently? At least Griffen thinks so. Bilal Powell became the clear starter for the New York Jets after Matt Forte was diagnosed with turf toe after week three. Powell took full advantage of the opportunity, rushing for 163 yards and a touchdown, while Hurns sat on Griffen’s bench and put up 42 yards on four receptions. This one’s simple enough. John satisfied an immediate team need with running back, at least while Forte is out, while Griffen traded a solid running back for a depth wide receiver.

**Game of Jones Grade: D**<br>
**Sea Turtles Grade: A**<br>

**Jae trades Terrelle Pryor to Griffen in return for Evan Engram and Wendell Smallwood**

Evan Engram deserves more attention. Engram has had at least four receptions and 44 yards in each of the first four games and has improved either his yards or receptions every week so far. Through four weeks, he’s a top eight tight end and should be viewed as a weekly starter from here on out rather than a streaming option. With this trade, Podorovsky satisfied a team need at tight end and received one of the hottest waiver wire pickups of the young season in Smallwood, while giving up just a depth wide receiver whom he has no need for with Green, Hogan, and Thielen headlining the WR corps. For Schmelter, this trade again doesn’t make a ton of sense. Schmelter traded away a RB, his weakest position, and a solid TE starter for a player who is at best his WR5 or so.

**Team Podorovsky Grade: B+**
**Game of Jones Grade: C**

Now, welcome to a new segment which I have aptly named the “Game of the Week” segment. In this part of the post, I will preview the GotW, which will be determined by the lowest total from the two teams in the power rankings.

**GAME OF THE WEEK: SEA TURTLES @ MARCUS MARIYODA**<br>
Two weeks ago, I’d have envisioned this matchup being a blowout. Now, it’s an East division showdown between two of the highest-scoring teams in the league. Despite losing David Johnson, GM John Keenan and the Sea Turtles have rallied in the last two weeks, totaling 252.8 points (highest in the league) during that span. Leonard Fournette has established himself as an upper-echelon RB1 and Jaguars workhorse of the future. Fournette has scored three touchdowns on the young campaign and and already has 71 carries. Brandin Cooks headlines the wide receiver corp for the Turtles, but he’s been rather quiet so far this season besides a week three outburst for almost thirty points. The Turtles will miss quarterback and steady play Drew Brees to a bye this week, but, assuming Matt Forte’s turf toe keeps him sidelined another week, the Fournette-Powell-Abdullah RB combo is probably the most underrated group in the league. Make no mistake: the Turtles are underdogs here, but an upset wouldn’t shock me. On the other side, you’ve got Colin Gorney and Marcus MariYODA. Todd Gurley has reintroduced himself to the fantasy football world after a disappointing sophomore campaign, scoring seven touchdowns in four games en route to a PRK1 after four weeks. Gorney is the only team to have surpassed the centennial mark in all four games so far this year, but he’ll likely be missing out on RB Ty Montgomery after reports have surfaced in recent days that Montgomery has multiple broken ribs. Playing isn’t out of the question for TyMont, and so Gorney will have to find a backup, especially after Jamaal Williams practiced fully today, making it look like waiver wire pickup Aaron Jones might not be used as heavily as we thought. Overall, Gorney is the clear favorite and the league leader in PF, and he’ll look to improve to 5-0 against the scrappy Sea Turtles in this GotW matchup.
