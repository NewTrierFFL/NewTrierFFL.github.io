1) BUTTERS NATION (2-0) <br>
In an unprecedented and unforecasted turn of events, the two rookies have ascended to the top of their respective leagues. Marc Mestanas has ridden Kareem Hunt and his two 20+ point games to the #1 spot of the NTFFL, while Kareem Hunt has established himself as one of the top dogs among running backs in the NFL and leads all running backs in total fantasy points through two weeks. Hunt’s proficiency out of the backfield has made him one of the elite dual-threat backs in the NFL and Marc was lucky enough to pair him with Devonta Freeman to form the league’s most feared RB tandem. Furthermore, Stan’s team sports star wide receiver Dez Bryant who, despite a disappointing week one, rebounded in week two with a statline of 7/59/1 against the Broncos vaunted secondary. Kelvin Benjamin led the Panthers in targets in week two with eight and, with Greg Olsen out for the time being for a broken foot, Benjamin is in line to see even more targets than usual. Combine those two with Delanie Walker as Mr. Reliable at tight end reestablishing himself as Marcus Mariota’s top target despite the trio of Eric Decker, Rishard Matthews, and Corey Davis at WR and you’ve got yourself a fantasy football contender. That said, Marc’s team is *not* on the same level as previous champions yet. Just last year, GM Ezra Wallach assembled a superteam with Ezekiel Elliot (NFL leading rusher), Mike Evans (top three WR), and Doug Baldwin (top ten WR) and so Mestanas has to continue watching the waiver wire like a hawk, but for now, first-year GM Marc Mestanas gets to enjoy the view from the top of the league.

2) Marcus MariYODA (2-0) <br>
Put simply, Colin Gorney at 7 in last week’s edition of the power rankings is one of the largest oversights in NTFFL power ranking history. Gorney’s team is one of the few that can challenge Mestanas for the title of best running backs in the league, with Todd Gurley and Ty Montgomery at the helm. Gurley erased any concerns about week one’s pedestrian YPC in week one, torching a dismal Redskins’ defense for 5.5 YPC on the ground, 136 total yards and a couple of trips to the endzone. Gurley looks like a new-and-improved version of his 2015 self, adding to his already potent skillset by expanding his role through the air. Gurley is locked-and-loaded as an RB1 going forward. Ty Montgomery joins Gurley in the backfield and, unlike Gurley, TyMont failed to erase concerns about his YPC in week one, averaging just 3.5 YPC on the ground but salvaging his day with six receptions for 75 yards and a score against Atlanta. While Montgomery isn’t a terrific runner, he is quite clearly the best running back on the Packers skill-wise and that makes him an RB1 simply based on opportunity. With Randall Cobb potentially missing some time due to a shoulder injury (did not practice Wed.) and Jordy Nelson hampered by a quadricep injury (he did practice Wednesday), Montgomery should see a lot of receptions from the league’s best offense. Montgomery has experience as an NFL WR and should be PPR gold and will be Gorney’s second top twelve back going forward. After that, Gorney has Mike Evans, who dazzled in his 2017 debut, totaling seven catches for 93 yards and one touchdown in the Bucs blowout win against Chicago. Joining Evans is Larry Fitzgerald who sputtered in week two along with the rest of the Cardinals offense. Arizona clearly missed stud RB David Johnson and the defense was able to key in on Fitzgerald without the dual-threat Johnson in the backfield. Fitz should see a lot of targets, but they’ll be slightly less productive targets in an anemic Cardinals offense. Still, Fitz is a strong WR2 due to volume. With two stud RBs and a stud WR, Gorney is a legit championship contender for arguably the first time in his NTFFL career. 

3) Cookin up in a Crock pot(1-1) <br>
GM Eli Lieberman’s team is looking very solid, thanks in part to a few big draft gambles paying off. Dalvin Cook and Jay Ajayi have both looked like RB1’s, which is a huge draft win for this team. After locking down a solid WR1 in AJ Green early in the draft, Eli couldn’t possibly be happier with having found 2 top tier running backs after the first round. Adam Thielen is also looking like he has a chance to put up solid numbers because of his rapport with QB Sam Bradford. Incredibly, not only does Lieberman have a fearsome starting lineup, but he has incredible depth too. Somehow, he can get away with Alshon Jeffrey and Tyreek Hill on his bench, simple because he has better options. What the actual heck. Commish Nat, who is writing this paragraph and happens to be in dire need of wide receiver help is current salivating out of jealousy. Too jealous to keep writing. Well done, GM Eli, well done. 

4) I Like Hugging my Cousins(1-1) <br>
With Anderson starting earn his role as the sole starting running back on the Broncos, GM Jae has excellent RB depth. His third RB is Jordan Howard. Talk about upside for a flex. However, keeping him this low in the rankings make sense if you look at his receivers. Terrell Pryor has not looked at all the the stud WR1 he was made out to be, and GM Jae obviously hoped he’d be with how high he drafted him. He has shown little rapport with Kirk Cousins, and the coaching staff doesn’t trust him enough in the Red Zone to throw him a goal line fade. In fact, the Redskins threw two straight fades to players under 6 feet tall (Pryor is 6’5’’). That says something about how his team views him. After Pryor, this team has a bunch of startable flex players. Overall, the depth will prevent this team’s WR situation from becoming too bad, but it’s currently looking lackluster. This team is still looking like a lock to make the playoffs.

5) Knile River (1-1) <br>
O Risen Zeke, be our resurrection and life. <br>
Be the resurrection and the life for us and all whom you have made.<br>

Be the resurrection and the life for those who do not believe of your terrific feats<br>
Be the resurrection and the life in leagues that believe that your week two performance is *not* a fluke, and rather a trend. Show them the light. <br>
Be the resurrection and the life in us who know the good but fail to do it, who draft Knile Davis in the fifth round<br>
Be the resurrection and the life for those dying to win a champinoship<br>
Be the resurrection and life for those imprisoned unjustly and those imprisoned justly <sup>like Josh Gordon.</sup><br>
Be the resurrection and life for those who live under regimes that seek to crush all who proclaim resurrection and life <sup>like Roger Goodell’s NFL.</sup><br><br>
Be the resurrection and the life in families where the weak are hounded by your 1,600+ yard rookie year.<br>
Be the resurrection and the life in relationships that are falling apart due to fantasy football<br>
Be the resurrection and the life for those whose years are snuffed out at the draft. <br>
Be the resurrection and the life for Teddy Kamin, as he aims to rebound after a heartbreaking championship loss last season. <br>
Amen. <br>
Apparently it’s plagiarism not to cite my sources so I’d like to thank Christianity Today for inspiring me to write a player about a twenty-three year-old man I’ve never met before in my life. Also, I’d like to highlight Michael Grabthree’s 3 TD performance last weekend and the fact that Teddy has Zeke and Odell on his team.

6) SCLSU Mud Dogs(1-1) <br>
Because quite frankly, this takes way too long, and Jack always seems to write his own 
anywho, I’ll keep this short and sweet: This team is solid but not exceptional, with good wide receivers and a group of running backs that may seem thin by season’s end. Or not. This might also become very good. Or maybe not. Who knows. I guess this is why GM Jack is ranked smack dab in the middle.

7) Game of Jones (0-2) <br>
Griffen complained to me every day in English and even sat at my lunch table one day to complain about how I was underestimating him and so, for whatever reason, he was rewarded with a jump in the power rankings despite a second straight loss. Anywho, Griffen’s team sports Julio and Baldwin so that’s solid as a rock, but Marshawn Lynch is on the wrong side of 30 and who the hell knows, if he pulls a hamstring this week, he could decide he prefers eating Skittles to playing football and nope right on out of the NFL. For the time being though, Lynch is a high-end RB2 with upside in the Raiders’ fast-paced offense. Schmelter’s team lacks a strong RB2, but waiver wire pickup Javorius Allen has led the Ravens in touches the last couple weeks and he outsnapped Terrence West by more than thirty snaps in week two, although part of that can be attributed to a slight injury nagging West. For now, Schmelter’s team is just outside of the top six, but they need a waiver wire pickup or trade before I list them as true championship contenders. 

8) Thomas Squad (1-1) <br>
GM Nicholas Kebo’s team was lambasted in last week’s power rankings, and they responded in a big way. Behind more than 50 combined points from the dynamic duo of Brady and Gronk, albeit against the Saints’ sorry excuse for a secondary, Thomas Squad scored more than 130 points in week two, by far the most that anyone has scored yet this season. Gronk, when healthy, is a game-changer at tight end and Kebo will have a weekly advantage there as long as Gronk’s groin holds up. Furthermore, Kebo’s WR trio of Demaryius and Michael Thomas, after whom the team is named, and Emmanuel Sanders. Michael Thomas has the hardest part of his schedule behind him after facing Xavier Rhodes and the trioof Malcolm Butler, Devin McCourty, and Stephen Gilmore in weeks one and two. Now, Thomas’s schedule opens up and, as Drew Brees’ #1 target, Thomas could be in for a huge year with 120+ targets and 8-9+ TDs. The Denver duo of Thomas and Sanders were both near the top of the league last season in red zone targets and with Northwestern graduate Trevor Siemian looking more and more like a competent NFL QB, the Denver offense could be straight-up lethal this year. Thomas and Sanders are both WR2s and Kebo’s WR trio is underrated among those in the NTFFL. However, running backs are still a glaring issue. Frank Gore is ol’ reliable for Kebo’s team, having not missed a game in the last six years, but Kebo is starting Denver Broncos backup running back Jamaal Charles as his RB2. In the event that Gore’s age catches up to him or Charles’ knees explode for a third time, Kebo would be left with Latavius Murray as a starter. Not that that would be much worse than being forced to start Charles, but it really illustrates how grim Kebo’s RB situation is. Kebo’s QB/WR/TE can and will win him some weeks, but he’s not a playoff contender until he finds some legit RBs.

9) Trust the Process(1-1) <br>
We are all starting to lose trust in this process. It isn’t going well. Hilton will be underwhelming until Luck gets back, which will be who knows when, Wilson has no offensive line, McCoy can disappear on any given week because his team can’t play football, Michael Crabtree is an early season favorite to catch 50 tds this season, all at the expense of Amari Cooper, and the list goes on. It seems as though the only way to properly express all of my thoughts about this team, I have expressed it through Michael Jackson’s “Bad.”
<br>
Well they say the sky's the limit<br>
And to me that's really true<br>
But my friend you have seen nothin'<br>
Just wait 'til I get through<br>
Just try and trust the process<br>
Is what I’m tryin’ to tell you<br>
But obviously that’s not possible...<br>
Because I'm bad (at fantasy football), I'm bad (at fantasy football) come on<br>
You know I'm bad (at fantasy football), I'm bad (at fantasy football) come on, you know<br>
You know I'm bad (at fantasy football), I'm bad (at fantasy football) come on, you know<br>
And the whole world has to
--Michael Jackson, arr. Nat Swinger

10) Loquacious Lamps (0-2) <br>
Regardless of Nat’s claims (read: excuses) about his team’s unfortunate luck, the Lamps have yet to show any sign that they are playoff contenders this season. LeVeon Bell is showing some obvious rust from his extended holdout but he’s still LeVeon Bell, and he’ll figure it out eventually. The rest of the Lamps, however, leave a little bit to be desired. D’Onta Foreman looked better than expected in his Texans debut, which could spell trouble for his Houston counterpart and the Lamps’ RB2 in Lamar Miller. Still, Miller has proven himself as a startable running back and, although he isn’t flashy, he is consistent. Miller lacks upside but with Bell also there in the Lamps’ backfield, there isn’t exactly a shortage of upside. The problem with the Lamps’ lies with the WRs or rather, the lack thereof. DeAndre Hopkins has been peppered with targets under rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson, but as is to be expected with a rookie QB in a terrible offense, the targets haven’t exactly been productive and Hopkins salvaged his fantasy day last Thursday night with one huge drive in the fourth quarter. If Watson can turn it around, Hopkins has low-end WR1 potential with lowish upside due to the fact that the Houston offense won’t see many scoring opportunities. Pierre Garcon projects as the Lamps #2 WR and, while he’ll see a lot of targets in the San Fran offense, he, much like Hopkins, won’t see many TDs especially in a tough NFC West. After that, Travis Kelce headlines the rest of the team as one of the best tight ends in fantasy football. If Kelce can increase his TDs, which looks like a possibility in the Chiefs revamped offense, he will finish as a top two tight end with relative ease. Overall, the Lamps are lacking at WR and if they can find a stud pass catcher on the waiver wire, watch out.

11) Sergio Dippshit (1-1) <br>
Keenan Allen dispelled any concerns about being rusty after injury in week two, breaking the 100 yard mark in week two against the Dolphins. Allen is Rivers’ #1 target and, through two weeks, is seeing a whopping 27% target share, the highest of Allen’s bright young career. If Allen can stay healthy, he’s a no-brainer top twelve receiver in one of the best offenses in the league. However, GM Ezra Wallach paired him with Antonio Brown, taking some of the pressure to perform off of Allen. Brown and Allen is likely the best WR duo in the league as long as both are healthy. However, the same problems as a week ago linger for Wallach. Christian McCaffrey is an unsatisfactory RB1 and, until Doug Martin returns from his suspension, Wallach is left without an RB2, although Samaje Perine could serve as a replacement if Rob Kelley’s injury lingers, although Kelley is currently listed as day-to-day according to Redskins coaches. With the WR duo of Brown and Allen and Jordan Reed at tight end last week (see the last two weeks’ editions for my thoughts on Reed), Sergio Dipp and the gang aren’t terrible, but until Martin gets back and reestablishes himself as a top twenty RB, Ezra’s team is going to be ranked near the bottom of the league.

12) Sea Turtles (1-1) <br>
Go forth, David Johnson, from this world <br>
in the name of the fantasy gods, the almighty Fathers, <br>
who created you, <br>
in the name of Kareem Hunt, Son of the living God and new overlord of the fantasy football realm, <br>
who suffered for you, <br>
in the name of the Holy Spirit, <br>
who was poured out upon you, <br>
go forth, faithful David. <br>
May you live in peace, without any broken wrists, this day, <br>
may your home be with God in Phoenix, <br>
With Bruce, the head coach of the Arizona Cardinals, <br>
And with John Keenan, your rightful owner. <br>
Rest in peace, David Johnson, you sweet, beautiful prince, you. <br>
