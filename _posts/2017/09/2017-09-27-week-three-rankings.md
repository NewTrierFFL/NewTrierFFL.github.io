**1) Marcus MariYODA**<br>

Another big week from the Yodas has them reprising their role as the premier team in the NTFFL. With seemingly unstoppable rbs, that rival those of BUTTERS NATION, and a reliable wr core led by Mike Evans, the only concern for this organization is injury to one of their rbs who have struggled with minor injuries in the past, and can normally seen with a Q next to their name. With that being said, so long as they play through that, there's normally a large double-digit number next to the Q… With Gurley at PRK 2 and averaging 3.8 YPC and Ty Montgomery at PRK 5 and thriving in the Packers overpowered offense with 3.0 YPC and a high volume of targets in the passing game, there is absolutely no sign of slowing down for the Yodas. As if that were not enough to carry this team all the way to the championship, surprising (albeit inconsistent) points from Marcus Mariota and Larry Fitzgerald to support this stellar RB tandem ensure a high point total for this team every week. Finally, first-rounder Mike Evans’ consistent performances further cement this team’s spot as the cream of the crop in the NTFFL. 

**2) BUTTERS NATION**<br>

BN had one of the biggest weeks on the trade block in the league. It went largely overlooked due to the fact that the team’s core players didn't leave. However, in the case of BN, this is a good thing. No, not good, great. They managed to keep the only rb duo that can compete with Gurley and Montgomery, and simultaneously got an elite tight end in Travis Kelce. NTFFL analysts indicate that BN won this trade, and therefore improved their team with the addition of Kelce. They also dished out Kelvin Benjamin and Rob Kelly, who seemingly have a tough battle with injuries for the foreseeable future, and got Amari Cooper. With that being said, Cooper despises the end zone more than our commander-in-chief hates players kneeling. But, the league has spoken, and BN got the better end of the deal with Cooper. Aside from their Ws on the trade block this week, BN’s core players are as strong as ever, as Kareem Hunt continues to dominate the NFL with an insane 8.5 YPC, an almost guaranteed TD every game, and 137 yards on 9 receptions. Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman continue to tear things up down south with Freeman’s 4 TDs and Coleman’s heavy involvement in the high volume Atlanta passing game. A solid duo of Dez Bryant and Amari Cooper in the wr slots strengthens this team… sort of. While the two make this team look unbeatable on paper, the numbers don't lie. Dez’s underwhelming 114 receiving yards this season, and Amari Cooper’s aforementioned hatred of the end zone, leave this WR duo relying on TDs from Dez. However, a combined 20 points on a weekly basis from Cooper and Bryant is a realistic expectation, which means as long as the rookie superstar can maintain his current form, and the TD twins down south don't let up, the rbs on this team might just be enough to give rookie GM Marc Mestanas a ring in his first season.

**3) SCLSU Mud Dogs**<br>

Many teams made some acquisitions on the trading block this week. None of them made headlines as big as GM Jack Miller did. On a historic Tuesday night with many moves around the league going on, Miller topped it off by acquiring  Antonio Brown to his squad for the likes of Carlos Hyde and Stefon Diggs. Diggs single handedly put Miller's team in the win column in week 1 (and almost week 3) but, this shrewd businessman and GM didn't think twice about ditching his best performing wide receiver for AB. Now Miller's team will revolve around the hands down best wide receiver corps in the league and a solid supporting cast of players. He has proven that he belongs in the top 3 by putting up the most PF in the league, but unfortunately he has a 1-2 record. With that being said there is no doubt that he will his team deserves this 3 spot. With the most dynamic relieving duo, Bro

**4) Thomas Squad**<br>

As Thomas Squad continues to perform as a legitimate playoff team, they continue to climb the power rankings. A huge blockbuster trade with Cookin’ Up In a Crock Pot is a make or break move for Thomas Squad. The addition of Jay Ajayi in a Dolphins offense that will undoubtedly rely on the running game throughout the rest of the season, and multitalented Tyreek Hill who has the ball in his hands frequently helped the Squad out in a big way. However, shipping off Gronk was the painful price. The 11 point Brady-Gronk-Gostowski plays were brought to an abrupt end, and the decision that Demaryius Thomas was the man in Denver, as opposed to Emmanuel Sanders was a tough one, which resulted in Emmanuel Sanders packing his bags. Only time will tell if this trade was a tally in the W column or in the L column for the Thomas Squad. Regardless, this was a consequential turning point in the season for Thomas Squad, for better or worse. Aside from the addition of an actual rb1, and the shipping off of the league’s best te, not much has changed for the team. The wide receiver trio is still one which commands respect as one of the best in the NTFFL, Tom Brady is still the GOAT at football and at life, and Frank Gore is still barely breathing. If Brady can continue to play like the god that he is, Gore can squeak out a td per game, Ajayi can live up to expectations at his new organization, and the Ravens defense gets back to their week 1 and 2 form, this team can truly claim the title of “the real deal.” However, if Gore dies (Vegas odds have this as about the same as Teddy winning the championship), Brady’s old age catches up to him, and Ajayi cracks under the pressure, Thomas Squad will have to rely heavily on their eponyms (The Thomas's) and Tyreek Hill. Bottom line, it's hit or miss with these lads, but as of right now it looks like it's hit.

**5) Cookin Up In a Crock Pot**<br>

Wow. Tuesday was big for GM Eli Lieberman to say the least. He remodeled his team in a big way with a couple of controversial trades. He gave up three of his top players in Green, Ajayi, and Thielen, but ended up with Gronk, Jordan Howard and Sanders in return. Only time will tell if such a massive shakeup was the right move for a team already looking so good, but for now, he looks much deeper overall. 

**6) I like Waving to my Cousins**<br>

After a large trade to acquire significant upgrades at receiver while maintaining decent receiver depth, this team did get better, but the teams above him just have higher upside with more scoring potential. Amazing the trade happened considering the GM’s lack of self confidence. 

**7) Knile River**<br>

Decent team, with the potential to make a playoff run. I honestly didn't even look at his team, but I have an AP chemistry test to study for and Kebo and Marc failed to write more than half of these damn rankings so here I am at 11 at night trying to crank out some rankings while also realizing I don't know how to balance a chemical equation and am unloading my feelings I this one paragraph to make it look longer. If you couldn't tell this is the last one I wrote. I have better things to be doing and am in a bad mood. Nat out.

**8) Sea Turtles**<br>

This team is very shallow, but surprisingly good for a team that lost their no. 2 overall pick and a stud TE. 

**9) Sergio Dipshit**<br>

Thinks very highly of himself, and I guess his players are kind of listening. Just lost to the Lamps, though. That's embarrassing. #positiveselftalk

**10) Loquacious Lamps**<br>

My team is absolutely incredible. Don't know why I am ranked this low. I even won this week.*

*<sub><sub><sub><sub><sub>*Disclaimer: my team is actually very bad.<sub><sub><sub><sub><sub/>*

**11) Trust the Process**<br>

Not only do I not trust this process, I think GM Kost doesn't even trust his own process, as he has been completely unable to do any hurtful trash talking this season.

**12) Game of Jones**<br>

Go check the standings if you disagree. #Scoreboard

Trade grades: <br>

**Miller trades Stefon Diggs, Carlos Hyde to Ezra in return for Antonio Brown**<br>
Let’s start with the blockbuster trade of the year to date. Wallach traded away Antonio Brown, quite possibly the most valuable player in fantasy football at this time, in return for two rising young superstars. Carlos Hyde has historically been an RB1 when healthy, but health is an issue; Hyde has never played a full sixteen games in his three years as an NFL pro. However, for the time being, Hyde is a strong RB1 as the 49ers workhorse. Stefon Diggs is also on the come-up as the Vikings #1 WR, and Diggs displayed fantastic promise in the Vikings win over Tampa, hauling in eight of eleven targets for 173 yards and a pair of scores. Diggs has created a reputation for himself that he starts hot and finishes cold. This year, he continued with a hot start (#1 WR at 20.5 PPG after three games), and it’s yet to be seen if he can continue as a WR1. For the time being, Diggs is at least a high-end WR2 with top-end WR1 potential. Wallach amped up his depth as well as bolstered his RB core with this deal, adding Carlos Hyde to a backfield that already had Doug Martin and Christian McCaffrey. Hyde gives Wallach a legit RB1/RB2 combo and, with Martin set to return in week five, Ezra’s RB combo is underrated amongst league insiders. Miller, on the other hand, paired Antonio Brown with Jordy Nelson to create an unprecedented level of dominance at the WR position. Although this leaves his RBs a little weak (Murray and Carson starting), the WRs are more than enough to make up for it.<br>

**Eli trades Jay Ajayi, Tyreek Hill to Kebo in return for Rob Gronkowski and Emmanuel Sanders**<br>

The two biggest trades of the 2017 NTFFL season happened 53 minutes apart. Miller and Wallach set their deal into motion at 6:55 CT, just 53 minutes after Kebo and Eli completed their blockbuster at 6:02. With this deal, Kebo has transformed his team from one that was ridiculed endlessly and ranked in last the first two weeks, to one of the top teams in the league and a championship contender. Jay Ajayi gives Kebo a legitimate RB1 and Tyreek Hill is a high-end WR2 at least, and the electrifying Oklahoma State product has potential to be much more if Andy Reid continues to use him as he has in the first three weeks. Kebo’s team now boasts Hill in addition to the Thomas bros of Michael and Demaryius, meaning Kebo’s WRs, while not on a Mud Dogs level just yet, are exemplary. Despite losing Gronk, Kebo can slot in Charles Clay and still feel confident about his TE position. Eli secured a huge upgrade at tight end in landing the best tight end in football today with Rob Gronkowski. Gronk is a game-changer and gives Lieberman a huge weekly advantage over other owners at the tight end position. Sanders is a nice flex and could even be a WR2 for a lot of teams, so he’s another nice snag. <br>

**Cookin’ up in a Crock Pot Grade:** B
**Thomas Squad Grade:** A
**Blockbuster Rating:** 8.5

**Nat trades Travis Kelce to Marc in return for Delanie Walker and Willie Snead**<br>
In comparison to the other trades that happened this week, this one barely registers on the Blockbuster Scale™. Still, Nat traded a top three tight end (or top two, depending on what you think of Zach Ertz - personally, I prefer Ertz to Kelce, but I’m biased as the Ertz owner) in return for a mediocre tight end and an upside play in Snead. Ted Ginn actually played in 2WR sets over Snead in the preseason, but hey, it’s preseason. Snead projects to be Brees’ #2 in the high-octane Saints offense, and he has flex appeal, although he’s more of a low-end WR3 until we see how the Saints plan to use him. Kelce is the largest piece of the trade, as Stan continued his quest to stack his starting lineup. Overall, Marc didn’t need Snead (but if he pans out, he’ll regret this move) but the upgrade at tight end will pay dividends down the road. <br>

**Jae trades Jordan Howard, Mohamed Sanu, Tarik Cohen for Adam Thielen, Browns D/ST, AJ Green**<br>

First of all, what does it say about the magnitude of Tuesday’s trades that you could argue this is the third-most important trade of the day? Jae upgraded his WR1 from Chris Hogan to AJ Green. Green is a bona fide stud and, despite a disappointing opening two weeks, the transition from Ken Zampose to Bill Lazor as Bengals offensive coordinator paid dividends for Green in week three as he finally looked like his usual WR1 self. Adam Thielen is currently top three in the league in receiving yards and actually has more than Vikings counterpart Stefon Diggs, but don’t be fooled: Diggs is still the #1 receiver in the Minnesota offense. Still, with the improved offensive line giving the quarterback more time in the backfield, Thielen holds flex value and boasts some of the best hands in the league. Thielen’s upside is limited by Diggs, but Thielen is still a solid flex for the time being. Eli received a borderline RB1 in Jordan Howard, but Howard still has some concerns, notably an AC joint sprain in his shoulder that forced him to check out of Sunday’s game against Pittsburgh multiple times, and Howard visibly turned his hurt shoulder away from oncoming defenders, later admitting that the pain in his shoulder was immense but that he had to play through it. When healthy, Howard should be seen as a low-end RB1, but the injury is a cause for concern. Tarik Cohen seems like a new and improved Darren Sproles (RIP) so far in 2017, leading all RBs in receptions through three weeks. Cohen is a low-end RB2 in half-PPR for now, but if he keeps up this pace, he will finish the season as a top twenty back. <br>
