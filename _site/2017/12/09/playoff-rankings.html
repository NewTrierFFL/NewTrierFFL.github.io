  <li>Marcus MariYODA (11-2)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Colin Gorney and co. broke the record for best regular season in NTFFL history in 2017, starting the season scorching-hot with a ten-game winning streak. The Yodas cooled off near the end of the regular season, but that can be partially attributed to the team taking their foot off the pedal after such a rousing start. Todd Gurley is the no.1 running back in fantasy football and is averaging nearly twenty points per game while Mark Ingram is right on the brink of being a top five back. Put simply, Colin has the best running back duo in the league and, although there are major concerns about the rest of his team, his running backs are consistent enough to keep this team afloat regardless of how the other players perform. If the Yodas can get any production from Keenum, Fitz, or Mike Evans, watch out.

  <li>Chicago Mud Dogs (8-5)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>“I say Kamara though. It’s however you want to say it,” Alvin Kamara said during one of his first days in training camp.<br /></p>

<p>“You think by the end of the year, people will know how to say your name?”<br /></p>

<p>“Yeah, definitely.”<br /></p>

<p>He was right. <br />
<br />
Still just 22 years old, the University of Tennessee product paced the lead in fantasy points among non-quarterbacks during the month of December. With five straight 20+ point games, the Chicago Mud Dogs have ridden their rising tailback to eight consecutive weeks of surpassing the centennial mark and a playoff berth in the 2017 NTFFL playoffs. After AK-41, the Dogs sport an extremely high-floor team headlined by fellow Saint Michael Thomas and the Houston Texans’ Lamar Miller. The Dawgs are perhaps the most consistent team in the league, but they could use some consistency near the bottom of the roster - since week nine, Mud Dogs kickers are averaging just four points per game and defenses under the league average as well. GM Jack Miller opted to sign savvy veteran placekicker Matt Bryant to a ten-day deal to try to fix the kicker woes. If Chicago can ever get production from tight end Jack Doyle, the defense, and the kicker in the same week, look out.
<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Brady Bundch (9-4)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Because the Brady Bundch won the West division and therefore have a first-round bye, this week doesn’t directly matter for any starters, barring injuries. Still, GM Nicholas Kebo will be watching to see if the Green Bay Packers can beat the Cleveland Browns this weekend to improve to 7-6, as a Packers win strongly increases their chances of bringing back Aaron Rodgers off of injured reserve. If Rodgers returns, Kebo has the best 1-2 punch in the league in Antonio Brown and Jordy Nelson at the wide receiver positions. Jason Garrett was quoted Wednesday as saying that “27 is a good amount of carries for [Alfred Morris]”, and, if he’s true to his word, Kebo’s team becomes straight up <em>scary</em> with Brown, Jordy, Morris, and reliable tight end Zach Ertz. Adrian Peterson has been banged up recently so the Bundch’s running back problems aren’t completely solved, but GM Nicholas Kebo has a definite championship contender on his hands.
<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Succ the Process (7-6)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Despite a heartbreaking stat correction loss, Succ the Process comes into the playoffs as the hottest team in the league. Keenan Allen in particular has been absolutely scorching the last few weeks, going over 10/100/1 in each of the last three games. Although that pace is unsustainable, Allen is a top-end WR1 heading into the playoffs. After Allen, GM Andrew Kost has assembled a deep RB corps headed by the two-headed monster of Joe Mixon and Carlos Hyde. Mixon is likely to miss week fourteen with a concussion and so Kost’s playoff hopes will rest in the hands of either Kelvin Benjamin, Marqise Lee, or Jamaal Williams. Kost has also put together two top-tier QBs with two MVP candidates in Russell Wilson and Carson Wentz. With momentum and fantastic RB options on their side, STP looks dangerous heading into the playoffs.
<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>SmallWood Big Butker (9-4)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>Once dubbed the team with the most running back depth, GM Jae Podorovsky and his team is an example of how much can change in just a few short weeks. Chris Thompson’s injury, Devontae Booker’s emergence in Denver, and Latavius Murray resurrecting himself in the Vikings’ RB pecking order has weakened Jae’s team significantly. McKinnon is expected to be the RB2 headed into the playoffs, but with Murray getting the goal line carries and the Vikings winning so much, McKinnon has limited upside since most of his value comes from receptions. Still, Podorovsky has probably the best WR duo in the league (at least until Rodgers returns and Jordy vaults back into the top twelve) with Adam Thielen experiencing a breakout season and AJ Green doing what AJ Green does. The Jaguars D/ST has been a revelation this season, finally breaking past the they’ll-be-scary-next-year phase and into the league’s elite. Averaging 14.3 PPG, the Jags give Jae a weekly advantage at the defense position. Although ranked at number five, #1-5 are way too close rank perfectly.
<br /><br /></p>
<ol>
  <li>BUTTERS NATION (8-5)<br /></li>
</ol>

<p>After a hot start, BUTTERS NATION has staggered into the playoffs following Kareem Hunt’s deterioration and Devonta Freeman’s injury struggles. Freeman is back for the playoffs, once again providing the Falcons 1-2 punch of Freeman and Coleman as a RB1/flex option for BN, but Hunt himself has looked like nothing more than a flex option the last few weeks, failing to hit paydirt since week three. BN’s wide receiver corps are lacking as well: Marvin Jones is one of the most underrated wideouts in fantasy football and is actually averaging nearly thirteen points per game, but Adam Thielen has surpassed Stefon Diggs as Case Keenum’s primary target in the passing game in Minnesota, severely limited Diggs’ upside. Travis Kelce is the #1 tight end for fantasy football purposes so far this year, on pace for over one hundred catches and 1,100 yards, but BN’s lack of talent at the other critical positions is worrying for their title hopes.</p>
