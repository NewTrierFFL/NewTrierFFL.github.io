    <p>1) Cookin’ up in a Crock Pot (1-0) <br />
No surprise that the top spot goes to the highest scorer in week one, but what <em>is</em> surprising is that GM Eli Lieberman managed to do it without his second-round pick or a starting defense. Jay Ajayi and the Dolphins didn’t play in week one after Hurricane Irma forced the NFL to reschedule the game to week 11, and Lieberman pulled the Chargers defense late Monday night to eliminate all doubt about a victory. Dalvin Cook cooked the Saints defense en route to setting the franchise record for most rushing yards by a rookie in his debut, besting Adrian Peterson’s record by twenty yards. Latavius Murray proved to be a complete nonfactor, touching the ball only a couple times and fumbling once, while Jerick McKinnon only came in to spell Dalvin Cook for short periods at a time. Cook was heralded as a dual-threat running back, but he had as many drops as catches on Monday night. After one week, Dalvin Cook looks like he’ll be worth his late-rising ADP and is an RB2 going forward, assuming he fixes the drops issue. AJ Green struggled in week one, scoring single digit fantasy points despite seeing double digit targets. However, most of the blame for Green’s struggles can be pinned on quarterback Andy Dalton. Around the league, the benchmark for an average quarterback is known as Dalton Line (shoutout to <a href="http://ftw.usatoday.com/2017/06/nfl-andy-dalton-line-average-nfl-players">USA Today</a> for creating the term) and, assuming Dalton returns to the Dalton Line next week, Green is a top five WR ROS, but he does face a tough Texans defense in week two. Adam Thielen now has 100, 150, and 200 yard games in three of his last five games and he led the Vikings in targets as he got open time and time again for QB Sam Bradford. Diggs and Thielen are 1A and 1B in the Minnesota offense and, if the offensive line can continue to give Bradford time in the pocket, both Vikings WRs will be startable as a WR2 and flex, respectively. However, with Diggs and Thielen both mandating targets, there isn’t much left over for Kyle Rudolph. Rudolph saw just three targets on Monday, luckily cashing in for a touchdown on one of them. Rudolph is a definite TE1, but don’t expect him to finish as the #2 overall TE like he did last year.</p>

<p>2) SCLSU Mud Dogs (1-0) <br />
Always the bridesmaid but never the bride, GM Jack Miller has never been number one in the weekly power rankings. However, after a nailbiter in week one, number one is within reach as Miller lands at #2 this week. Thanks to Stefon Diggs’ Monday night heroics and a little bit of luck, Miller squeezed past Jae Podorovsky by just 0.04 points, the slimmest margin of victory possible under the current league scoring settings. Diggs had seven receptions on eight targets to go along with 93 yards and two touchdowns on Monday against the Saints and, with Sam Bradford looking like he’s adjusted to the intricacies of a Pat Shurmur offense and one of the easier schedules for WRs in the league, Diggs is a sure WR2 moving forward. Aside from Diggs, Zach Ertz is the only player who performed well above expectations last weekend, hauling in eight passes for 93 yards in the Eagles’ win against the Redskins. <br /> Of the Packers trifecta, only Jordy Nelson proved worth his ADP (17.4 points), as Rodgers only threw for one touchdown and Davante Adams predictably had a down week as he was shadowed by shutdown corner Richard Sherman. In week two, the Packers head to Atlanta for what should be a high-scoring game on Sunday Night Football. Expect a bounce-back from Rodgers and Adams in week two. <br /> DeMarco Murray had a disappointing week one, totaling just 44 yards on twelve carries, although he dominated Derrick Henry in total snaps. Murray now goes to Jacksonville to face one of the best front sevens in the league. However, the Titans should be ahead in this game rather than behind, as they were against Oakland, and so it’s not time to hit the panic button yet. Carlos Hyde only had nine carries, but that’s due to the game flow and the Panthers jumping out to a big lead against the 49ers. That will be a common trend as the 49ers will be underdogs in most games, but it’s encouraging that Hyde was the clear bellcow in San Francisco, notching fifteen total touches compared to Matt Breida’s four. Coming off one of the most exciting games in league history, the Mud Dogs take on Marcus MariYODA in week two.</p>

<p>3) Knile River (0-1) <br />
Perhaps the most surprising week two ranking, Teddy Kamin’s team comes in at #3 despite losing week one. News broke last week saying that Ezekiel Elliot was granted a temporary restraining order (TRO) by a judge, meaning that the NFL can’t suspend him until the lawsuit is completely finished. There’s a strong chance (&gt;75%) that that doesn’t happen until after the fantasy season, unless the NFL somehow wins an appeal against the TRO. Pairing Zeke with fellow first-round talent Odell Beckham spells trouble for opposing teams and, although Beckham couldn’t play week one, Kamin’s team still managed to put up a fight against Marcus MariYODA before falling on a garbage time reception by Mark Ingram. Going forward, Beckham and Zeke is undoubtedly the strongest 1-2 punch in the league and, despite being weak at flex after Willie Snead returns from suspension and relegates Ted Ginn back to the WR3 in New Orleans, the RBs and WRs on this team are championship level. Isaiah Crowell sank any doubts about Duke Johnson and Matt Dayes stealing touches in the Cleveland backfield as the Crow cawed his way to seventeen carries and, although he could only manage 33 rushing yards, it’s encouraging that Crowell received so many touches despite the game script being against him. Jimmy Graham disappointed against Green Bay, as Russell Wilson had no time to throw thanks to Pro Football Focus’ #32 offensive line performing as projected. Graham’s upside is limited by the Seahawks porous offensive line because it could force Graham to stay back and block. <br /> Depth is the only thing keeping the Knile River from flowing into a top two spot as, frankly, every player on Kamin’s bench is droppable, save for Jonathan Stewart or Ted Ginn, especially after Darren McFadden was a healthy scratch on Sunday and Alfred Morris handled the backup role for the Cowboys. With Winston back and playing sixteen straight games with all of his old weapons plus DeSean Jackson at his disposal and Zeke + Beckham wreaking havoc on the league, the River is a championship contender heading into week two. Just pray that no one gets hurt, because the bench is sorely lacking.</p>

<p>4) Trust the Process (1-0) <br />
LeSean McCoy gave GM Andrew Kost a scare after briefly exiting the game on Sunday holding his wrist, but Shady returned after letting fullback Mike Tolbert vulture a touchdown. Shady did Shady things on Sunday, totaling 159 yards on 27 touches and racking up 18.4 fantasy points despite not having a touchdown. Amari Cooper got into the endzone, a rare sighting as Michael Crabtree and Seth Roberts normally take most of the passing touchdowns in Oakland. If Cooper and QB Derek Carr can develop better redzone rapport this season, Cooper will finish as a WR1 and probably be a first round pick in 2018 drafts. Nonetheless, Cooper tallied just shy of fifteen fantasy points on Sunday and looks like a solid return on investment moving forward. Russell Wilson struggled mightily on Sunday against a rather mediocre Packers defense. The Seahawks offensive line, well, just <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/Dah_knee/status/907003577788391424">see for yourself.</a> Thankfully, Wilson is one of the better QBs in the league at performing with a bad line due to his ability to move outside the pocket and run if need be. However, if the offensive line continues to push out abysmal performances, Wilson’s value goes down, but Wilson the Seahawks receiving corps have historically performed better at home. The Hawks have a much friendlier matchup in week two against a 49ers defense that struggled against Cam Newton (although Cam Newton struggled right back at them), so Wilson is still a top five option at the QB position for week two. <br /> Terrence West performed better than expected, getting the ball nineteen times and rushing for exactly eighty yards and one touchdown. However, after Danny Woodhead went down with an injury, the more talented Javorius Allen stepping up and actually had more carries than West did. Moving forward, I still expect West to lead the backfield in carries and touches and it’s definitely possible Allen only received more touches because the Ravens were ahead by so many. West isn’t the best RB2 in the league, but he’s serviceable there simply due to the volume he’ll receive. Golden Tate notched double digit receptions and topped the centennial mark in the Lions’ 2017 debut, but now he faces a Giants secondary that allowed two catches to Dez Bryant. It’s possible that the Lions move Tate around to the slot in an attempt to draw Janoris Jenkins off of him, but Tate could be in for a disappointing week two. Joe Mixon outsnapped Jeremy Hill last weekend, but only averaged about 1 YPC with nine yards on eight carries. The Ravens run defense is stout and the Bengals had a tough day in general, but Mixon is an RB3 with upside until further notice. However, Kost’s team is no doubt top five in the league, and the sky’s the limit, especially if Mixon pans out sometime this year.</p>

<p>5) BUTTERS NATION (1-0) <br />
Kareem Hunt was the story of week one, scoring 43.1 points despite fumbling on his first NFL carry. Hunt torched the New England defense for almost nine yards per carry on the ground and almost twenty yards per reception. Hunt was simply spectacular, bulldozing through New England defenders as a runner and torching linebackers through the air. Going forward, Hunt isn’t a bona ride RB1 in the way that LeSean McCoy, LeVeon Bell, and Melvin Gordon are, but he is still a top twelve running back, where he is joined by fantasy teammate Devonta Freeman. Freeman had fourteen touches to Tevin Coleman’s twelve and Coleman dominated the touches in the passing game, so it’s possible that the timeshare in Atlanta is closer than most people predicted, but Freeman is still an RB1 despite a lackluster week one performance that was saved by a five-yard touchdown. Dez Bryant disappointed fantasy owners in week one, hauling in just two catches for 43 yards. Dez looks to rebound in week two against the Broncos secondary, one of the few secondaries in the league that can claim to be better than the Giants secondary that Dez faced in week one. After that, the Cowboys face Arizona, where Dez will be shadowed by cornerback Patrick Peterson, one of the top cover corners in the league. Then the Cowboys face the Los Angeles Rams and corner Trumaine Johnson. Dez and his owners could be in for a rough few weeks with tough matchups ahead. Benching Dez isn’t really an option due to his touchdown upside, but expectations should be low the next few weeks due to a brutal schedule. Phillip Rivers looks like he’ll be the sorter for Mestanas after Andy Dalton scored <em>-3</em> points on Sunday, almost costing Stan a win. Rivers performed better than expected against the Broncos vaunted cornerback duo, piling up 17.7 fantasy points thanks in large part to tossing three touchdown passes. The Chargers offense is one of the better offenses in the league, which means that Rivers could be in for a QB1 season, and Mestanas has Andrew Luck on the bench who’ll hopefully be back if Rivers ever starts to falter. Samaje Perine proved to be a nonfactor for the Redskins, not touching the ball even once as Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson established themselves as the clear top two in the Redskins running back pecking order. Kelley is a strong RB3 and safety valve should anything happen to Hunt or Freeman and Willie Snead will be the #2 receiver in a Drew Brees offense upon his return, meaning Mestanas’ team is not lacking in the depth department. With possibly the best running back tandem in the league, Marc’s team is a playoff contender whose championship chances will depend on the wideouts.</p>

<p>6) I Like Kissing My Cousins (0-1) <br />
John Fox has a shiny new toy to play with, and play with him he did. Tarik Cohen showcased his electrifying speed and unmatched elusiveness in week one en route to 113 total yards on thirteen touches. Despite the breakout day from the rookie, Cohen is <em>not</em> a no-brainier start going forward. Cohen touched the ball on almost half of his snaps despite receiving only five carries, which is likely unsustainable going forward. Cohen only saw 28 snaps in his debut and now teams will be better prepared for the rookie running back out of North Carolina A&amp;T after seeing him torch the Falcons defense in week one. Cohen is a fringe RB3/4 going forward who likely won’t score many touchdowns due to his size. Speaking of Cohen, Jordan Howard’s value is not affected by a potential Tarik Cohen breakout season. Say it with me this time: <em>Jordan Howard’s value is not affected by a potential Tarik Cohen breakout season.</em> Howard saw 38 snaps to Cohen’s 28 and, although that might alarm fantasy owners, the two backs play completely different roles in the Bears offense. Cohen is 5’6” 175 soaking wet whereas Howard has the power to ram it in from the goal line. Coming into the 2017 season, we knew that Jordan Howard was a below average receiver after Howard logged eight drops with just 22 catches his rookie season. The Bears drafted Cohen and signed Benny Cunningham with the intent to find a better receiving threat out of the backfield and that was evidenced as there were multiple plays with Cohen lined up in the slot and Howard in the backfield. Howard is still the lower-end RB1 that he was drafted as going into week two. Meanwhile, Terrelle Pryor headlines Podorovsky’s receiving corps and, despite scoring single digit fantasy points in week one, Pryor saw eleven targets and established himself as Kirk Cousins’ #1 receiver ahead of Jamison Crowder, Jordan Reed, and Ryan Grant. Pryor is a low-end WR1/high-end WR2 with unmatched upside as the top receiver in a prolific passing offense. If Pryor continues getting the kind of usage he saw in week one, the numbers will come. For Martavis Bryant, the numbers most certainly did not come as the Alien only managed two catches for fourteen yards in his highly-anticipated return from suspension. There are a lot of mouths to feed in the Pittsburgh offense between LeVeon Bell, Antonio Brown, and, apparently, Jesse James. Bryant could’ve had a much bigger day had a target not glanced off his hands and into a defender’s in the redzone. Still, it’s not time to panic yet with Bryant as it <em>was</em> his first game after a year and a half away from football, so it’s entirely possible he’s still shaking off some rust. Bryant maintains his WR2 value heading into week one against a Vikings secondary that shut down the Saints prolific offense in week one. <br /> Podorovsky’s team is quite possible the deepest in the league - remember how Tarik Cohen is a fringe RB3/4 going forward? He’s Podorovsky’s <em>RB5</em> and his top four all went in the top six rounds according to ADP. If Jae can get some consistent production from his QB and/or TE, he’ll flirt with a playoff appearance for the first time in his fantasy football career.</p>

<p>7) Marcus MariYODA (1-0) <br />
One week and it’s already clear Todd Gurley is a new man– or possibly Jared Goff has finally figured out how to take pressure off of Gurley. Either way, he looks like a solid RB1, which is excellent value for his late second round ADP. As for Gorney’s other RB,’Mark Ingram is stuck in the dreaded running back by committee approach in New Orleans. All three backs got almost identical workloads, although Sean Payton admitted he was trying to figure out what he had at running back in their first game. The good news for Gorney is that of the three backs, Ingram and Peterson are the two power backs, and Ingram showed an ability to catch passes out of the backfield. This could lead to a more two-way timeshare between Ingram and scatback Alvin Kamara. Larry Fitzgerald is not a flashy WR1, but is solid, and has a high floor. Crowder got off to a slow start, and he may not heat up any time soon as long as Kirk Cousins has to ask his catchphrase, “You like that,” as a legitimate question; everything he has done so far this season and preseason has been shaky at best. Marcus Mariota has reached a stage in his career where he must take the next step and develop into a legitimate QB1 for both his team, and fantasy, and he has done nothing so far to show he isn’t on this trajectory. Gorney has so far put together a solid but boring roster with a high floor and low ceiling. A surefire way to avoid league purgatory? Yes. A good way to get into the playoff mix? Yes. A winning strategy? Most likely not. Look for Gorney to trade a lot of depth in the coming weeks for a star player to give his team a shot at winning it all, and not just joining everyone else along for the ride.</p>

<p>8) Loquacious Lamps (0-1) <br />
Apparently, LeVeon Bell was the correct choice at #1 overall after all. David Johnson was the #1 overall player almost unanimously among fantasy experts, but GM Nat Swinger bypassed all of their recommendations and selected LeVeon Bell first overall. With Johnson out for 2-3 months with a wrist injury, Bell becomes the #1 running back and most coveted player in fantasy football despite a disappointing week one. The Pittsburgh offense struggled as a whole on Sunday against the Browns, and Bell was no exception, toting the rock ten times and only picking up 32 yards. However, Bell is arguably the most talented running back in the league behind a top ten offensive line on a team that should win a lot of games, so he’s as close to a lock for top five running back as there is in fantasy football. The Texans duo of Lamar Miller and DeAndre Hopkins struggled in week one as the Texans allowed ten sacks to the Jaguars and never seemed to get anything going offensively. Miller saw seventeen carries and picked up 66 yards, but coaching staff has said this week that they want to get D’Onta Foreman more involved in the coming weeks, which could spell trouble for Miller’s upside, as Foreman is a bigger-bodied back more suited for goal line carries. Miller will receive all the carries between the 20s, but fantasy football games aren’t won between the 20s, they’re won in the end zone. Miller is a solid RB2 but, especially behind an offensive line that rivaled the Seahawks for worst in the league in week one, probably will not live up to where he was selected as #25 overall. DeAndre Hopkins had a couple of uncharacteristic drops in week one, but started performing better when rookie QB Deshaun Watson checked in for journeyman Tom Savage. The Texans coaches have already stated that Watson will start in week two against the Bengals, which slightly improves Hopkins’ value, but we’ve only seen Watson play one half of NFL football. Hopkins is a high-end WR2 ROS with upside if the Texans QBs start targeting him as Brian Hoyer did in 2015. The rest of Nat’s team is uninspiring, with the most important name being either TE Travis Kelce, who was completely shut down by the Pats in week one, or WR Pierre Garcon, who’ll take a breather on the Lamps’ bench after a productive week one while he faces the Seahawks vaunted secondary in real life. Nat’s team will have to rely heavily on LeVeon Bell for fantasy production in future weeks and will likely need a second star player in order to make a playoff push. Could this star be on the team already? Hell yes it is, Adam Vinatieri is about to go off. Hopkins? Miller? Maybe, but can you really count on the Texans offense?</p>

<p>9) Sea Turtles (1-0) <br />
The Sea Turtles had a bittersweet week one, beating the Loquacious Lamps by more than twenty points, by losing first-round pick and fantasy superstar David Johnson to a wrist injury for the next 2-3 months. Johnson and LeVeon Bell were, put simply, on a world of their own. Without Johnson, the Turtles will have to look to rookie Leonard Fournette as their RB1. Fournette is the most highly-touted rookie RB since Adrian Peterson came out of Oklahoma, and he didn’t disappoint in his debut, tallying <em>26</em> carries for one hundred yards on the dot and a touchdown. Earlier in the offseason, a reported asked Jaguars HC Doug Marrone how many times he wanted to pass the ball per game. Marrone answer, “Zero”, and apparently, he wasn’t kidding. The Texans have one of the best run defenses in the league and Fournette still gashed them for 19.9 fantasy points. If Fournette can keep up that kind of volume and stay healthy (which is no sure thing, as foot and ankle injuries have bothered him since his LSU days), he’s a no-doubt RB1. <strong>Brandin Cooks</strong> highlights the Turtles’ receiving corps, and Cooks had a three receptions for 88 yards in his Patriots debut, although he had a few long gainers called back due to penalties. Now, Cooks heads to New Orleans to take on the Saints, whom Stefon Diggs and Adam Thielen absolutely <em>torched</em> on Monday night to the tune of 250 yards and two touchdowns combined. Cooks is in for a big week and is still a top ten receiver moving forward. Sammy Watkins made his Rams debut on Sunday, but yielded to Cooper Kupp as the leader among Rams WRs for receptions, yards, and TDs. Watkins is still the #1 receiver in Los Angeles, but Kupp could be more productive than we think in a gym rat, scrappy, gritty, first one into the gym/last one out type of way. Think Wes Welker or Danny Woodhead. Anyway, Watkins is a decent WR2 as long as he’s healthy which, in the past, has been quite the ask for Watkins, but with Jared Goff looking much improved in his sophomore season and Sean McVay revitalizing the Rams offense, Watkins is a low-end WR2 moving forward. With Drew Brees at quarterback and Greg Olsen at tight end, the Turtles’ starters are surprisingly decent despite the injury to Johnson. However, depth, and namely RB3-5, is a huge problem and another injury to a starting RB (namely Fournette, who’s proven himself to be injury prone in the past) would be devastating.</p>

<p>10) Game of Jones (0-1) <br />
Despite putting up the second-most points in the league, GM Griffen Schmelter’s team lost and places at tenth in the power rankings this week. Marshawn Lynch showed no signs of rust in his first game back from retirement, showing shades of Beast Mode at times against the Titans. Bilal Powell is still in a timeshare with Matt Forte and, even worse, he’s on the Jets. Powell’s upside is capped by the low-scoring Jets offense, but he’s at least a low-end RB2 for now. Julio Jones underperformed in week one, but that’s to be expected considering that Jones is one of the most inconsistent wide receivers in the game. Doug Baldwin also struggled in week one as Russell Wilson had no time to throw, which limited the Seahawks red zone opportunities, where Baldwin normally makes his money. Paul Perkins showed why he is quite possibly the worst NFL starting running back in the league fantasy-wise, gaining only sixteen yards on seven carries and being outplayed by backfield mate Shane Vereen. Schmelter didn’t have Jarvis Landry due to Hurricane Irma, so Landry will make his 2017 debut this Sunday against Chicago. Landry is a solid flex play despite valid concerns about Devante Parker overtaking him for the #1 receiver in Jay Cutler’s Miami offense. Schmelter’s wide receivers have a legitimate shot at being the best in the league this season, but, as I mentioned in the preseason power rankings, Lynch is a risky RB1 and Powell is an uninspiring RB2. Furthermore, Schmelter lacks depth at key positions, with his RB3 being oft-injured Thomas Rawls and his RB4 being Duke Johnson, who saw some hype in the preseason due to a potential move to the slot, but he disappointed fantasy owners, scoring just three points in week one. An injury to a starting running back would derail this team’s playoff hopes in an instant, but the WRs are scary enough to carry this team for a few games this year. Tight end will be a constant problem for Griff’s team throughout the season, but he was able to strike gold on the waiver wire thanks to Coby Fleener and a garbage time drive in the fourth quarter of the Saints-Vikings game. It’s yet to be seen if Schmelter plans on sticking with Fleener or streaming a different tight end every week but, either way, this team will be giving up points at the tight end position every week, all season long. If Schmelter can strike gold on the waiver wire and find the Jordan Howard or David Johnson of 2017, this team immediately becomes a top six team.</p>

<p>11) Sergio Dippshit (0-1) <br />
Say whatever you want about having Christian McCaffrey as an RB1 or Adrian Peterson as an RB2, but Sergio Dipp is an American (Mexican?) icon and honoring him with a team name is a stellar idea. Seriously, if you haven’t already, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9F0f013sLIo">go see for yourself.</a> It’s glorious. Now, onto less important matters: Christian McCaffrey saw eighteen touches in his NFL debut, far exceeding most owners’ wildest expectations, but still managed to score single digit fantasy points due to a fumble in the second half. However, 18 touches for CMC in his debut is encouraging and, although the production isn’t there yet, it will come. McCaffrey is already one of the most electrifying players in the league and his combination of burst and agility has endeared him to many fans across the league. The problem lies with Adrian Peterson. Much to the chagrin of fantasy owners and Saints fans, it’s not 2008 and Adrian Peterson is not a fantasy football starter. In fact, Adrian Peterson might not be worth a roster spot anymore. Alvin Kamara led Saints running backs with 41 snaps and Mark Ingram was second. Peterson finished with just six carries and was visibly frustrated on the sidelines with his lack of touches. Peterson is <em>not</em> an NFL starting running back anymore, and he’s not a fantasy starter either. GM Ezra Wallach has to wait three more weeks for Doug Martin to return before he’ll have a viable RB2. Antonio Brown dazzled in the Steelers opener to the tune of eleven catches for 182 yards. Brown has a somewhat legitimate chance to reach 2,000 receiving yards this season and he’s off to a great start this year. Keenan Allen has already lasted twice as long as he did last season, playing a full two halves in the Chargers week one loss to the Broncos. Allen saw ten targets and was productive fantasy-wise despite facing the Broncos elite CB duo of Aqib Talib and Chris Harris, Jr., and he’s a low-end WR1 ROS. The rest of Wallach’s team, namely Brandon Marshall and Jordan Reed, struggled in week one, but both have proven to be valuable fantasy commodities in the past and should bounce back to meet their ADPs over the course of the season. However, Ezra’s running backs, both the starters and the depth, remain problematic and it’s tough to see him rising into the top six without a true RB1 or RB2. That said, it could be worse. He’s still miles better than the worst team in the league. There’s a true tier drop after the top eleven.</p>

<p>12) Thomas Squad (0-1) <br />
At this point, Thomas Squad’s owner should just throw in the towel. All is lost. There is no hope. He should probably crack open a cold one and start preparing for next season. Unfortunately, cracking open a cold has consequences in the NTFFL, such as missing the draft, as GM Nicholas Kebo is well aware. I guess there is nothing left to do except work on his tan line so he can show it off in the glorious pink sleeveless polo he will inevitably earn. As far as the reason his season is all but over, his team is just overall bad. Other than Brady and Gronk locking down the two most important positions in fantasy football (sarcasm) he has a team of WR2’s. While this is better than some teams could hope for, his team of WR also-rans and the entire Patriots offense could not make up for the absolute disaster that is his running back corps. Frank Gore is 34 and still chugging along, doing his best to ensure that he’ll be backed by Social Security checks by the time his football playing days are over, and he and can not possibly take pressure off of a team with one of the worst offensive lines in football. With no breakaway speed, and no holes to run through, playing Gore as an RB1 is basically just accepting forty yards rushing every week and no scoring, but hey! You know he won’t fumble. And then there is Eddie Lacy. Oh, Eddie Lacy. While Pete Carroll’s general disposition and some measly cash incentives are all that are keeping Lacy from ballooning into a defensive tackle on any given week, there is absolutely nothing in between Lacy and his path to the bottom of Seattle’s depth chart. He lacks the burst to play in today’s NFL, and so while I’d love to go have lunch with him, I do not want him starting on my fantasy team. An injured Thomas Rawls is a safer weekly play, because he’ll score a similar number of fantasy points per week, and won’t lose points by fumbling after being rocked by literally any player on any opposing defense. Playing any Seattle running back is a significant risk. At this point, Old Man Kicker Phil Dawson could power through the Seahawks o-line and crunch the running back for a loss. Speaking of kickers, Stephen Gostkowski is a beast. Possibly the best player on the roster, he is Kebo’s only chance at not coming in last #KickersWinGames #KickerLivesMatter #KickersArePeopleToo</p>
